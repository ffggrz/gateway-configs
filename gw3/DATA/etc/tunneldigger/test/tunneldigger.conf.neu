connection_rate_limit=0
; Reject connection if an IP address connects more than COUNT times in TIME seconds. Also runs
; "broker.connection-rate-limit" hook (e.g. to block client via iptables).

[hooks]
; Note that hooks are called asynchonously!

; Arguments to the session.{up,pre-down,down} hooks are as follows:
;
;    <tunnel_id> <session_id> <interface> <mtu> <endpoint_ip> <endpoint_port> <local_port>
;
; Arguments to the session.mtu-changed hook are as follows:
;
;    <tunnel_id> <session_id> <interface> <old_mtu> <new_mtu>
;

; Called after the tunnel interface goes up
session.up=/etc/tunneldigger/test/session-up.sh
; Called just before the tunnel interface goes down
; (However, due to hooks being asynchonous, the hook may actually execute after the interface was
; already removed.)
session.pre-down=/etc/tunneldigger/test/session-pre-down.sh
; Called after the tunnel interface goes down
session.down=
; Called after the tunnel MTU gets changed because of PMTU discovery
session.mtu-changed=
; Called when the tunnel connection rate per ip limit is exceeded
broker.connection-rate-limit=
